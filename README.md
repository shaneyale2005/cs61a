# [UCB CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://cs61a.org/)

Welcome to my repository for **UC Berkeley's CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**!

This repository serves as a personal collection of my work, notes, and solutions for the CS61A course. CS61A is an introductory programming and computer science course at UC Berkeley, focusing on fundamental concepts of computational thinking, program structure, and abstraction.

## Course Overview

The course primarily uses **Python** as its teaching language. Key topics covered include:

* **Functional Programming**: Understanding functions as first-class citizens and their role in program design
* **Recursion**: Mastering recursive thinking for elegant problem-solving
* **Object-Oriented Programming**: Exploring classes, objects, and inheritance for structuring complex programs
* **Data Abstraction**: Learning to design and use abstract data types
* **Sequence Processing**: Techniques for manipulating lists, tuples, and other sequential data
* **Iteration and Recursion**: Comparing and contrasting iterative and recursive approaches
* **Tree Traversal**: Algorithms for navigating tree data structures
* **Interpreter Design**: Gaining insight into how programming languages are interpreted

The aim of CS61A is to equip students with the skills to design, analyze, and optimize programs effectively.
