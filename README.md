# [UCB CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://cs61a.org/)

This repository serves as a personal collection of my work for the CS61A course. CS61A is an introductory programming and computer science course at UC Berkeley, focusing on fundamental concepts of computational thinking, program structure, and abstraction. The course primarily uses Python as its teaching language.

The course covers a wide range of topics, including functional programming, recursion, object-oriented programming, and data abstraction. Students learn to design and use abstract data types, manipulate sequential data, and compare iterative and recursive approaches to problem-solving.
